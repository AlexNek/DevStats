# DevStats â€“ Repository Analysis Tool ðŸ“Š

DevStats is a WPF application for analyzing C# repositories.
It scans your entire solution or project folder, gathers file statistics, detects auto-generated code, and presents the results in a clean, interactive dashboard.
Optional `.gitignore` support lets you exclude ignored files from the analysis when desired.

## Features

* Repository-wide analysis of all files in a C# project
* Optional `.gitignore` support to skip ignored files and folders
* File size statistics with histograms and tables
* Auto-generated file detection and exclusion
* Visual dashboard with charts and sortable tables
* Markdown export for documentation and sharing
* Plugin system to extend analysis with custom C# modules

## Configuration

DevStats uses `appsettings.json` for configuration. Available settings:

| Setting                      | Type      | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ExcludeAutogeneratedFiles`  | Boolean   | Exclude auto-generated files from statistics                      |
| `AutogeneratedFilePatterns`  | String\[] | Patterns used to detect generated files                           |
| `HistogramMaxBins`           | Integer   | Maximum number of bins used for the file size histogram           |
| `AutogeneratedFileScanBytes` | Integer   | Number of bytes scanned when determining if a file is generated   |
| `UseGitIgnore`               | Boolean   | If enabled, files/folders listed in `.gitignore` will be excluded |

## Plugin System

DevStats includes a plugin architecture for extending functionality. You can add new statistics, customize analysis, or integrate with other tools.

### To create a plugin:

1. Implement the `ICardPlugin` interface.
2. Create the XAML and ViewModel for your pluginâ€™s UI.
3. Register your plugin in the `Plugins` list:

   ```csharp
   var plugins = new List<ICardPlugin>
   {
       new FileExtensionCountCardPlugin(_appSettings),
       new CsStatisticsCardPlugin(_appSettings)
   };
   ```
4. Build the project and run the application.

> Note: This version uses a static plugin list for simplicity. A future enhancement could allow dynamic loading of external DLLs.

## Usage

1. Select your C# repository (solution or project folder).
2. Adjust settings, including whether to apply `.gitignore`.
3. Run analysis to view file extension stats, size distributions, and C#-specific metrics.
4. Export Markdown reports for documentation or sharing.
